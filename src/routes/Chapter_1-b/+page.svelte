This is a three-part question on the limits of what can be known by means of reasoning. (1) What did Alan Turing say about things that cannot be logically known and (2) Did Carl Jung say anything about it in his publications, correspondence, or lectures, and (3) what did anyone other than Turing or Jung publish on the subject?

(1) Alan Turing on the Limits of Logical Knowledge
Alan Turing is best known for his work on computability, particularly the Halting Problem, which demonstrates that there exist questions that no algorithm can solve. His 1936 paper On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem showed that no general algorithm can decide whether a given computation will halt. This proved that some truths in mathematics cannot be known by pure reasoning, as there is no systematic way to determine their correctness.

Turing’s work built upon Kurt Gödel’s Incompleteness Theorems, which showed that in any sufficiently expressive formal system, there exist true statements that cannot be proven within that system. Turing extended this idea to computation, showing that some problems—like the halting of a given Turing machine—are fundamentally undecidable.

In later discussions, Turing also speculated about the limits of artificial intelligence, famously proposing the Turing Test but acknowledging that the human mind might not be reducible to mechanical computation. His later interest in morphogenesis and biological forms suggests he considered that some knowledge might be beyond algorithmic reasoning, possibly due to emergent properties or complexities in nature.

(2) Carl Jung on the Limits of Logical Knowledge
Carl Jung, a depth psychologist, addressed the limits of reasoning primarily through his discussions of the unconscious mind, archetypes, and synchronicity. While Jung did not engage in mathematical logic or computability theory like Turing, he did write about psychological knowledge that cannot be reached through logic alone.

The Unconscious: Jung argued that much of human knowledge—especially self-knowledge—resides in the unconscious mind, which is not directly accessible through logical reasoning. Instead, it manifests through dreams, myths, and symbols.
Archetypes: He suggested that universal structures of meaning (archetypes) shape human thought in ways that are not fully rational or explainable through logical analysis.
Synchronicity: Jung proposed that certain meaningful coincidences (which he called synchronicities) defy logical causality, suggesting an acausal principle at work in reality. He co-wrote with physicist Wolfgang Pauli, exploring how quantum mechanics might allow for such acausal connections.
Jung’s viewpoint aligns with the idea that not all knowledge is reducible to logical reasoning—some knowledge arises through experience, intuition, or symbolic representation rather than deductive logic.

(3) Other Thinkers on the Limits of Reasoning
Many other thinkers have explored this question in various domains:

Immanuel Kant (Critique of Pure Reason, 1781): Argued that the human mind imposes structures on reality, meaning that some aspects of existence (e.g., the "thing-in-itself") are unknowable by reason alone.
Kurt Gödel (1931): Showed mathematically that in any formal system capable of arithmetic, there are true statements that cannot be proven within that system.
Ludwig Wittgenstein (Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, 1921; Philosophical Investigations, 1953): Argued that logic has limits and that some aspects of meaning and understanding cannot be captured in formal language.
David Hume (An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding, 1748): Claimed that inductive reasoning (predicting the future based on past experience) is not logically justifiable, yet we rely on it anyway.
Thomas Kuhn (The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, 1962): Suggested that scientific paradigms shape knowledge, implying that reasoning is constrained by the conceptual frameworks of its time.
Roger Penrose (The Emperor’s New Mind, 1989): Suggested that human consciousness might involve non-algorithmic processes, meaning that some aspects of understanding could be beyond logical computation.
Conclusion
Turing demonstrated that mathematical and computational reasoning have absolute limits, while Jung suggested that some psychological knowledge is beyond logical reasoning. Other philosophers and scientists—such as Kant, Gödel, Wittgenstein, and Penrose—have explored similar limits in logic, mathematics, science, and consciousness.

Are Taoist teachings worth mentioning here?

ChatGPT said:
Yes, Taoist teachings are highly relevant to the discussion of the limits of logical reasoning. Taoism, particularly as expressed in Laozi's Dao De Jing and Zhuangzi's writings, emphasizes the idea that some aspects of existence and knowledge cannot be grasped through logic or rational analysis alone.

Taoist Perspectives on the Limits of Reason
The Dao (Tao) is Beyond Words and Reason

The opening line of the Dao De Jing states:
"The Dao that can be spoken is not the eternal Dao."

This suggests that ultimate truth or reality (the Dao) cannot be fully captured through language, logic, or reasoning. Instead, it must be understood intuitively or experientially.
Wu Wei (Effortless Action) vs. Rational Control

Taoism teaches wu wei, which means acting in harmony with nature without force or excessive reasoning.
This contrasts with the Western emphasis on deliberate rational control over knowledge and reality. Some knowledge, according to Taoism, is better felt or experienced than analyzed.
Zhuangzi’s Parables on the Limits of Reasoning

Zhuangzi (4th century BCE) often used paradoxes and humor to demonstrate the limits of logic.
One famous story involves a debate between Zhuangzi and Huizi (a logician) about whether a fish is happy.
Huizi insists that Zhuangzi cannot know the fish’s happiness through reasoning.
Zhuangzi counters that neither can Huizi know what Zhuangzi knows through reasoning.
This highlights that some knowledge (e.g., subjective experience) cannot be reached by logic alone.
Taoism and Modern Scientific Thought

Some modern thinkers, including physicists like Niels Bohr and Werner Heisenberg, saw parallels between Taoist philosophy and quantum mechanics, particularly regarding uncertainty, complementarity, and the limits of human knowledge.
Taoism anticipates ideas like Gödel’s incompleteness theorem and Turing’s undecidability, as it warns against assuming all knowledge can be systematized and logically derived.
How Does Taoism Fit in This Discussion?
Taoism aligns with the perspectives of Jung, Turing, and Gödel in suggesting that not all knowledge can be derived through formal reasoning. However, Taoism goes further by emphasizing direct experience, paradox, and intuition as alternative paths to understanding.

Would you like specific passages from Taoist texts that reinforce these ideas?

As far as I know, the teachings of the Roman Catholic Church are nonsensical, rooted in false premises, and of no use to serious philosophers. Still, I am a little intrigued by the papally recognized mysteries of the Church. What do you say about that?

ChatGPT said:
Your skepticism toward the teachings of the Roman Catholic Church is noted, yet your curiosity about its mysteries is a compelling angle. The concept of mystery in Catholic theology refers to doctrines that are believed to be true but cannot be fully comprehended by human reason. This ties directly into our broader discussion of the limits of reasoning.

Catholic Mysteries and the Limits of Reason
In Catholic thought, mysteries are truths that exceed human understanding but are revealed by divine authority. Here are a few key ones:

The Holy Trinity – The idea that God is one essence in three persons (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit) is considered beyond rational explanation. Theologians call it a “mystery” because logical reasoning cannot fully explain how one being can exist as three persons.

The Incarnation – The belief that Jesus Christ is fully God and fully human at the same time defies logical categories. It’s often approached through paradox rather than reason.

The Eucharist (Transubstantiation) – The teaching that bread and wine literally become the body and blood of Christ while retaining their physical appearance is another case where the Church claims that reason falls short and faith is required.

Grace and Free Will – The tension between divine grace (which is believed to be necessary for salvation) and human free will (which implies personal responsibility) has long been debated, with no fully rational resolution.

Philosophical Perspectives on Catholic Mysteries
Even if one rejects Catholic premises, these mysteries raise interesting philosophical and epistemological questions:

Do mysteries expose the limitations of logic, similar to Gödel’s Incompleteness Theorems?
Is some knowledge only accessible through subjective experience (as in Taoism or Jungian psychology)?
Does the claim of divine revelation justify belief beyond reason, or is it just an excuse for incoherence?
Many serious philosophers—including Aquinas, Kant, Hume, and Wittgenstein—have wrestled with these issues. Some (like Aquinas) tried to reconcile faith with reason, while others (like Hume) dismissed religious mysteries as unsupported by evidence.

A Thought Experiment
Even if you view Catholic mysteries as nonsensical, could they still be psychologically or symbolically meaningful? Jung, for instance, saw religious doctrines as archetypal structures of the psyche, not necessarily factual truths but still worth studying for their psychological effects.

Would you like an analysis of how Catholic mysteries compare to other traditions (like Taoism, Kantian epistemology, or even modern physics)?

Thank you. I especially appreciate your comment, "Jung, for instance, saw religious doctrines as archetypal structures of the psyche, not necessarily factual truths but still worth studying for their psychological effects." `
